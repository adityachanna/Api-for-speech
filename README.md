## ‚ú® Features

### ü§ñ Agentic AI Workflows
- **LangGraph-powered stateful agents:** Multi-turn, dynamic conversations.
- **Intent classification:** Routes messages based on user needs (`welfare_search`, `form_generation`, `general_query`).

### üìù Conversational Onboarding
- **Dynamic profile building:** Automated, stepwise collection of user data via natural conversation.
- **Smart data extraction:** Uses LLMs to parse responses and auto-fill profile fields.

### üîç Welfare Scheme Discovery
- **Personalized search:** Combines user profile + live web research for relevant schemes.
- **Hybrid LLMs:** Fast intent detection (Groq), detailed content (Google Gemini).

### üìã Automated Form Generation
- **End-to-end HTML forms:** Instantly generates styled, validated, and localized forms for scheme applications.
- **Web research integration:** Scrapes real requirements and eligibility from multiple sources for accuracy.
- **Language adaption:** Forms rendered in the user's local language (Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, etc.) based on state/profile.

### üì¢ Notifications & Recommendations
- **Compelling, actionable scheme alerts:** Clickable, benefit-focused recommendations tailored to each user.
- **Urgency, relevance, and prioritization:** High-priority schemes highlighted with emotional triggers and calls to action.

### üíæ Persistent Data Storage
- **SQLite backend:** User profiles and chat histories are saved for continuity and analytics.
- **Easy reset & profile management:** API endpoints to view or delete data.

### üñ•Ô∏è Integrated Modern Frontend
- **Responsive chat UI:** HTML/CSS/JS frontend served directly from FastAPI.
- **Rich interactions:** Dynamic notifications, form previews, downloads, modals, and real-time updates.

### üõ†Ô∏è Robust, Extensible API
- **RESTful endpoints:** For chat, profiles, notifications, health, and serving generated forms.
- **WebSocket support:** Optional real-time bi-directional communication for advanced integrations.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Workflow

**High-level Workflow:**  
The application is orchestrated as a directed graph with conditional logic, enabling sophisticated AI-driven dialog and task execution.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Check user profile}
    B -- Profile missing --> C{Onboarding}
    C -- Ask next question --> X((End turn))
    B -- Profile exists --> D{Intent detection}
    D -- Welfare search --> E[Welfare scheme search]
    D -- Form generation --> F[Form generation]
    D -- General query --> G[General conversation]
    E --> H[Format response]
    F --> H
    G --> H
    H --> I((End))
```

**Key Components:**

- **LangGraph StateGraph:** Controls the flow, tracks states, and enables conditional branching.
- **Workflow Nodes:** Modular functions for each logical step (profile check, onboarding, intent detection, search, form creation, final response).
- **Global Services:** Centralized management for LLMs, web search, database, and workflow.
